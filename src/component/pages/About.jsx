          What is the Zee<em>Meter</em> ?
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Zee<em>Meter</em>, which captures audience sentiment, is
          represented by a popcorn bucket and indicates the percentage of fans
          who have rated a movie or TV show positively. When we can verify users
          have bought a ticket to a film, the default score shown is composed of
          “Verified Ratings.” For all other titles, we display an “All” score
          that includes ratings from people regardless of whether or not we can
          verify that they have seen the movie. Titles displaying Verified
          Ratings also have an All score. To view it, simply click on the
          popcorn bucket and you can toggle between the two.

        <h2>Curation</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>ZeeFlix®</strong> has a team of curators whose job is to
          gather thousands of movie and TV reviews weekly. The team constantly
          collects movie and TV reviews from Tomatometer-approved critics and
          publications generating Tomatometer scores. Our curation process
          considers these reviews, noting if they are Fresh or Rotten, and our
          curators choose a representative pull-quote. Tomatometer-approved
          critics can also self-submit their reviews.
